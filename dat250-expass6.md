# Rapport: DAT250 Experiment 5
<h3>Technical difficulties</h3>
<p>For this experiment/lab I did not encounter particular problems. I just created a new gradle application and made the classes and copy and pasted like I was instructed to in the tutorial.</p>

<p>There are no pending issues for this project. It was quite straightforward and everything was resolved.</p>
